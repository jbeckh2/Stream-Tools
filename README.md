# Stream-Tools
Stream Tools are a set of small programs that I've created for streamers.  The first is a count down timer that writes the remaining time to a file.  You can set that file as the source in Streamlabs OBS as the source of a Text object.  The timer also includes the ability to change the text to a default message when the timer is complete.
